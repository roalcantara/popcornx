  - **apps/front:** A [React][19]/[Nextjs][21]/[Typescript][30] project (via [Vercel][31])
  - **apps/admin:** An [Angular][20]/[Typescript][30] project (via [Firebase][32])
  - **apps/api:** A [NestJS][21]/[Typescript][30] project (via [Heroku][33] or [Firebase][32] - not sure)
  - **libs/ui:** A [webcomponents][34] shared library (via [Storybook][35])
  - **libs/domain:** A shared library (following [Enterprise Monorepo Angular Patterns][29])
  - **unit tests:** Via [Jest][24]
  - **e2e tests:** Via [Cypress][25]
  - **code style:** Via [ESLint][26] and [Prettier][27]
- **Database:** Via [Postgres][41] or [Firestore][42] - not sure
- **UI:** Responsive (probably via [Tailwindcss][36])

### SCRUM/Kanban

  - Running [Lighthouse][38] checks during the CI process
  - Running [WebVitals][39] checks during the CI process
- **Test coverage:** Coverage report (probably via [Codecov][40])

- Run `npm run e2e` to run all e2e project's tests
- Run `npm run lint` to lint all projects

### Nx: Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System

This project was generated using [Nx][9].

#### Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular][13]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [React][14]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- [Express][15]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Nest][16]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Node][17]
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`

There are also many [community plugins][11] you could add.

#### Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

Run `nx generate @nrwl/angular:application my-app` to generate an Angular application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

#### Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@mono-nx-test/mylib`.

#### Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

#### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest][24].

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress][25].

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

#### Understand your workspace

Run `nx help` to update your workspace to the latest version of Nx.

Run `nx report` reports useful version numbers to copy into the Nx issue template.

Run `nx migrate latest` to update your workspace to the latest version of Nx.

Run `nx list` to lists the currently installed Nx plugins and other available plugins.

Run `nx list @nrwl/react` to lists capabilities in the `@nrwl/react` plugin

Run `nx reset` to clear all the cached Nx artifacts and metadata about the workspace and shuts down the Nx Daemon.

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

Run `nx workspace-lint` to lint nx specific workspace files (nx.json, workspace.json) and
check existence of the configured packages and apps.
**Note:** To exclude files from this lint rule, you can add them to the `.nxignore` file
